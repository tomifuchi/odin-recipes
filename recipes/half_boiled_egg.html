	  <p>You can read alot on the internet for alot of
		tricks to half boil an egg, but to do so is really
		easy to me. Atleast I think it's. 
		Get a stop watch or anything that can time moderately
		accurate. </p>
		<p>
		Put the egg or eggs into a pot with cold water,
		high heat, bring them to a boil. Exactly 7 minutes
		turn off the heat, run them under tap for several minutes.
		Crack and enjoy.</p>
