	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Box Spaghetti any kind</li>
	    <li>Garlic</li>
	    <li>Olive oil</li>
	    <li>Basil leaves</li>
	    <li>Salt</li>
	    <li>Pepper</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> This is quite a simple dish, with enough practice you can have this dish
	  out in under 30 minutes, let's begin:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Boil the spaghetti following package instruction until aldente.</li>
	    <li>Slice 2 cloves of garlic thinly.</li>
	    <li>Wash the basil leaves.</li>
	    <li>Fry the garlic in pan with 2 tbs of olive oil until golden.</li>
	    <li>Add the spaghetti, mix the garlic and spaghetti well, season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
	    <li>Turn off the burners, get it out to dish then enjoy.</li>
 	  </ol>
	  <p> Protip: To save time, if you can, try to simultaneously boil and cook the garlic in
	  the pan at right time. So that if the spaghetti is done, then immediately put into
	  the pan with the garlic.</p>
