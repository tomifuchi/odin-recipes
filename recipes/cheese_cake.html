	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>Cream cheese (If you don't have this, follow instruction below)</li>
	    <li>Pack of biscuits</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
		<li>Sugar</li>
	    <li>Water</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Have cream cheese ? If not follow these instrutions to make cream cheese. 
		The ingredients to make cream cheese are:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Milk full fat</li>
		<li>Cheese cloth</li>
		<li>Lemon juice/Lime juice or plain vinegar</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Directions to make cream cheese:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Put your milk in a pot, high heat to almost boil.</li>
		<li>Lower heat to simmer the milk. Be sure to stir the milk occasionally to not let it get burnt</li>
		<li>Then slowly, add 1 tbs then stirs into the milk. You will see small clumps start to form, that's our curls seperating from the whey</li>
		<li>Continune to add few tbs as directed above slowly until you feel like it's enough. And the curls totally separated from the whey</li>
		<li>Strain the curls from the whey with a cheese cloth on top of a sift.</li>
		<li>Use a food processor make curls into cream cheese. Add salt to taste if needed.</li>
	  </ol>
	  Now if you already have cream cheese, let's make cheese cake:
	  <ol>
		<li>Put the biscuits into a food processor, blend it to your liking.
			THis is going to be your bottom crust of the cheese cake. Coarse or fine
			whatever you like.
		</li>
		<li>Next, with a baking tray, spread your biscuits on there.</li>
		<li>Now put your cream cheese into a bowl, add 1/2 cup of sugar, or more 
			if you like sweets</li>
		<li>Add 4 eggs into it, then mix the cream cheese mixture to incorperates it.</li>
		<li>Pour the mixture into the baking tray with the biscuits crust under</li>
		<li>Pour water around the outside of the baking tray to not let the cheese cake dry up</li>
		<li>With 180 Celcius oven, bake the whole thing in about an hour</li>
		<li>Serve ! You can eat this with strawberries, bananas. Anything, go crazy.</li>
