	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>A pack of tomamtoes</li>
	    <li>Garlic</li>
	    <li>Onion</li>
	    <li>(Optional) Tomato paste</li>
	    <li>(Optional) Immersion blender</li>
	    <li>Olive oil</li>
	    <li>Oregano</li>
	    <li>Basil</li>
	    <li>Water</li>
	    <li>Salt</li>
	    <li>Pepper</li>
	    <li>(Optional) 2 pcs of toasts</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> Note: If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use the food processor or
	  a normal blender instead. And if you don't have any of those, then you can achieve
	  the same consistency by cutting everything before cooking very finely, and
	  simmer for longer time.</p>
	  <p> This recipe should be simple, but simmering time should be the majority of
	  the cooking time. Make
	  time to watch and stir the pot occasionally not letting the soup burnt or stick to the bottom of the pot, let's begin:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li> Cut and dice the tomatoes as small as you can.</li>
	    <li> Peel skin and slice onion and garlic thinly.</li>
	    <li> Put 2 tbs of olive oil into the pot.</li>
	    <li> Stir fry 1 tsp tomato paste (if you have them),  garlic until golden and onion until translucent.</li>
	    <li> Add Water or stocks (Any kind will do).</li>
	    <li> Add the tomatoes.</li>
	    <li> Put the heat to a boil, then turn down to lowest to simmer.</li>
	    <li> Simmer for about 15 minutes, seasons to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
	    <li> Add oregano.</li>
	    <li> Take out an immersion blender, blends the mixture well into a soup.</li>
	    <li> Pour the soup into a boil, top with a few basil leaves then serve with toasts on the side.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p> Protip: Use canned tomatoes and tomatoes paste for best flavours,</p>
