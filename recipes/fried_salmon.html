	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>Any cut of steak, New York strip steak is good enough.</li>
	    <li>A pack of tomamtoes</li>
	    <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Rose mary</li>
	    <li>Olive oil</li>
	    <li>Water</li>
	    <li>Salt</li>
	    <li>Pepper</li>
	  </ul>
      <p>For this recipe this should be easy to do, but try to time your
        cooking or it the steak will be overly cooked. Nobody wants
        an overly cooked steak. Let's begin:
      </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li> Wash the steaks and tomatoes</li>
        <li> Seasons the steak and tomatoes with salt and pepper</li>
        <li> Lay the tomatoes on a baking sheet, bake with olive oil covered for 15 minutes on 175 Celcius.</li>
	    <li> Put 2 tbs of olive oil into the pan, heat up then fry the garlic until the aromas start.</li>
        <li> Lay the steak into the pan, sears each side for about 10 minutes then put the butter in</li>
        <li> Put in the rose mary, bathe the steak with butter evenly on both side for 5 minutes</li>
        <li> Take out the steak, serves with tomatoes</li>
	  </ol>
