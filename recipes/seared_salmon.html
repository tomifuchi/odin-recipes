	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>A piece of deboned salmon</li>
	    <li>Olive oil</li>
	    <li>Salt</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Moister is enemy to crispy, wash clean the salmon piece
		then dry them throughly. Let's begin
	  </p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Seasons the salmon with salt and pepper</li>
		<li>With a pan with hot oil, skin down lay the salmon inside the pan</li>
		<li>Now the fish should bulke and shrink, to prevent this so that
			the whole piece can evenly cook. Use a slotted spatula, press 
			the salmon down. But gently, for 15 seconds.
		</li>
		<li>Use medium low heat to cook the salmon. Because
			the skin is naturally designed to insulates the insides.
			Rapid temperature increases causes the leaking of albumin, And
			uneven cooking. So medium low heat.
		</li>
		<li>Cook skin side down, about 90% completion then flip once</li>
		<li>Depends on your preference, 15 seconds or more on the other side.
			But remember that it's already 90% cooked, so don't spend
			too much time on the other side.
		</li>
		<li>Take out to a paper towel lined tray to remove excess oil. Then serve</li>
