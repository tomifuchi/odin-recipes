	  <p> To begin we need several ingredients :</p>
	  <ul>
  		<li>1 cup of flour</li>
		<li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
		<li>Half tsp baking soda</li>
		<li>1 tbsp of sugar</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>1 cup milk</li>
		<li>butter (melted,1 tbsp)</li>
		</ul>

			with practice. You can even apply a job
			at Pancake house down the block ! Let's begin:
		</p>
		<ol>

			<li>In a separate bowl, beat egg and add melted butter.</li>
			<li>Mix together two bowl together.</li>
			<li>Heat up a pan with butter or cooking spray</li>
			<li>Pour the mixture in, medium heat is fine, wait until there're bubble on top of the surface</li>
			<li>flip the pancake.</li>
			<li>Cook the other side for a few minutes then serve.</li>
			<li>Serve with butter and maple syrup on top. </li>
		</ol>
